# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello! I'm a Bachelor's student at Paramadina University, currently pursuing a degree in Teknik Informatika (Computer Science). Passionate about technology and innovative solutions, I enjoy learning new programming languages and exploring various aspects of software development.

Here you'll find some of the projects I've worked on during my studies, as well as personal projects that reflect my interests in coding, web development, and data analysis. I aim to enhance my skills while contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with fellow developers.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out ðŸ’¬ if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!

Happy coding!

Feel free to adjust any part of it to better reflect your personality or specific interests!
